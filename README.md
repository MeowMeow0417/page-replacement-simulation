# 📚 Page Replacement Algorithms – Case Study

This project presents an interactive simulation of three fundamental **Page Replacement Algorithms**—**FIFO**, **LRU**, and **OPT (Optimal Replacement)**—built using **React** and **TypeScript**. Designed for both educational and demonstrative purposes, the application visualizes memory operations with animations, providing an intuitive understanding of how each algorithm behaves.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

1. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**  
   - Replaces the page that entered memory first.

2. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**  
   - Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time.

3. **OPT (Optimal Replacement)**  
   - Replaces the page that won’t be used for the longest time in the future.

Each simulation visually represents:
- 🟩 **Cache Hits**
- 🟥 **Cache Misses**
- 🔄 **Page Evictions**

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### 🔹 Option 1: Run the Executable

1. Go to the `executables/` directory.
2. Download and unzip one of the following based on your OS:
   - `PageReplacementApp-Windows.zip`
   - `PageReplacementApp-Mac.zip`
3. Run the extracted `.exe` (Windows) or `.dmg` (macOS) file.

> ⚠️ *Executables are zipped to comply with GitHub’s 25MB file size limit.*
