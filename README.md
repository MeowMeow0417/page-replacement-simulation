# Page Replacement Algorithms â€“ Case Study

This project presents an interactive simulation of three fundamental **Page Replacement Algorithms**â€”**FIFO**, **LRU**, and **OPT (Optimal Replacement)**â€”built using **React** and **TypeScript**. Designed for both educational and demonstrative purposes, the application visualizes memory operations with animations, providing an intuitive understanding of how each algorithm behaves.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React (TypeScript)** â€“ A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, enhanced with static typing using TypeScript.
- **Framer Motion** â€“ A production-ready motion library for React to create smooth, visually appealing animations.
- **Electron** â€“ A framework for building cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Node.js + npm** â€“ Node.js enables JavaScript to run server-side; npm is its package manager used to install and manage dependencies.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
   - Replaces the page that entered memory first.

2. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
   - Replaces the page that hasnâ€™t been used for the longest time.

3. **OPT (Optimal Replacement)**
   - Replaces the page that wonâ€™t be used for the longest time in the future.

Each simulation visually represents:
- ðŸŸ© **Cache Hits**
- ðŸŸ¥ **Cache Misses**
- ðŸ”„ **Page Evictions**

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Run the Executable

1. Go to the `executable/` directory.
2. Download and unzip one of the following based on your OS:
   - `Cache Simulator Setup 1.0.0.exe.zip`
   - `Cache Simulator-1.0.0.dmg.zip`
3. Run the extracted `.exe` (Windows) or `.dmg` (macOS) file.

### Option 2: Run from the Live Site

You can also access the application instantly without setup by visiting the live deployment:

[https://page-replacement-simulation-zeta.vercel.app](https://page-replacement-simulation-zeta.vercel.app)

Just open this URL in any modern browser to use the interactive page replacement simulation online.
